# portfolio_python

My name is Malcolm Anderson, I am a Python developer who also happens to be a world traveling trainer and consultant.  But with all the glammor of spending weeks on the road, sitting in air ports, or planes, or hotels I keep coming back to my love for code.

However you got here, I welcome you to my portfolio.

The application I have to showcase for you is a Pomodoro application.

This application demonstrates unit testing, code organization, and UI development.

To run the project use the following command from the terminal
python3 pomodoro.py

If you are using vscode, you can open the folder as a dev container at which point, all the appropriate tools will  be built for you and the application will just run.
